# Homework 1

## Due on: Friday, 24<sup>th</sup> January 2025, at 11:59 pm ET. 

Welcome to ECE 20875, Python for Data Science! In this class, you will learn the basics of various topics in data science, and, along the way, learn how to write code in Python. To know more on how to accept this homework, please refer to the GitHub tutorial under Week1 on BrightSpace.

## Goals

This homework has several objectives:

1. Get familiar with git and GitHub: cloning, committing, tagging, etc.
2. Get familiar with the GitHub Classroom submission system.
3. Write a simple Python script demonstrating Python fundamentals.

## Grading

1. 30% of the homework corresponds to committing and pushing (submitting) the homework. If you were able to commit and push the homework, we assume you know the basic Git commands.
2. 35% - Problem 1 
3. 35% - Problem 2

## Background

### Version Control

Git is a version control tool. What is version control? It is a means of retaining
organized versions of your code as you work on a project. This is especially important 
in industry for code organization, collaborative projects, and large projects spanning many files.
Further information on how GitHub might be used in collaborative projects can be found at https://guides.github.com/ 
if interested. You will not be concerned with branches in this class.

When working with repositories for this class, there are three main parts to working with git: 
1. The remote repository (on GitHub) 
2. The local repository (on your device/ Scholar account) 
3. Your working files (on your device/ Scholar account) 

Note: Git is the tool you use to do version control. GitHub is where your remote repository is hosted.

When you do a `git add` followed by `git commit`, you are updating your local repository.
When you do a `git push`, you are updating the remote repository on GitHub (supervisors or collaborators can now see your changes).

The key commands you will need to use in this assignment (and at other times) are:

1. `git clone <url>`: This sets up a local repository on your machine by "cloning" (copying) a remote repository; in this case, a repository is set up on GitHub.
2. `git add <filename>`: When you have changed a file, you can "stage" it for the next version (i.e., tell git that you want the changes in this file to appear in the next version) using this command. (Note, when you want to just add/stage changes made to all files in a directory, consider "git add --all". Changes may include deletion of certain files.)
3. `git commit -m "<message>"`: Creates a new version of your code. This new version contains all changes staged in the previous version of the code. This new version only exists in your local repository.
4. `git push`: Updates the remote repository (on GitHub) with all the changes that you have `commit`ted to your local repository. Note that uncommitted changes will not appear on GitHub.
5. `git pull`: Updates your local repository with any remote changes that are on GitHub and have not yet been reflected in your local repository. Note that there may be some conflicts between what GitHub knows about a file and what your local repository knows, and this command will notify you if that happens (fixing those conflicts requires more work). You should always run `git pull` and resolve any conflicts before running `git push`.
6. `git status`: This shows you the status of any files in your local repository. In particular, it shows you any files that you have modified, but not yet `add`ed, and any files that you have `add`ed but not yet `commit`ted.

We will be using the latest version of your code (files present after your most recent push) at 11:59pm on the submission deadline for grading.

Push your code to GitHub often. Not only does that prevent you from
losing any code if you accidentally delete anything, it helps us help you
debug, by giving us access to your latest code.

NOTE: You should verify that your code files are showing up correctly on GitHub once you have `push`ed them from your local machine.

### Python

Familiarize yourself with basic python scripting from the lecture notes. The Python language documentation is online at https://docs.python.org/3/

This assignment has the potential to involve:
1. Initializing variables. Recall that unlike C, C++, etc., Python does not require a data type declaration.
2. Arithmetic (+, -, \*, /, %, **, //), logical (`and`, `or`, `not`), and comparison (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) operations.
3. Control flow (if, elif, else) structures.
4. A basic understanding of lists.
5. Functions that when given an input return a certain output. 

A caution: DO NOT use `&` and `|` as logical operators. They are for bitwise operations, which should not be used for conditional statements. Using them could lead to very hard bugs to find. As an example, `2 & 1` will give `0`, which will be read as `False` whereas `2 and 1` gives `1`, which is read as `True`. Instead of `&` and `|` you should use `and` and `or` in Python. 

Remember that indentation in Python is an inherent way of organizing code blocks.

Ex:

```
if True:
    print('HW1 is truly fantastic.')
print('I concur.')
```

Remember that functions are given certain values as arguments and may return a certain value (which is the case in this homework).

Ex:

```
def foo(x):
    if x < 10:
        return x*2
    else
        return x*4
```
so foo(3) would return 6 and foo(11) would return 44


## Getting Started

Use `git clone` to clone this repository locally. If you face issues with this, then you might want to look into using 'ssh key' to clone (directions at the end of this README). 

There should be two files in your repository when you begin:

1. This README file.
2. `problems.py`, a python file which contains functions you should fill in. A sample problem and solution are given.


## Instructions

After completing the 'Getting Started' section above, you will complete the functions in `problems.py` and verify it works using the provided test cases. You may then submit your code to GitHub using the git commands above and following the 'What to Submit and How' section below.

### Problem 0

This is a sample problem and solution that are not part of the grade. Its purpose is just to familiarize yourself with functions and the format for this homework

The objective of this sample problem is to determine if the num is divisible by 3, if the input is divisible by 3, the function will return the string "divisible" otherwise it will return "not divisible"

Test Cases:

Input = 1 -> Output = "not divisible"

Input = 2 -> Output = "not divisible"

Input = 3 -> Output = "divisible"

Input = 4 -> Output = "not divisible"


### Problem 1

Modify the problem1 function by adding additional lines of code so that it solves the following problem:

When given a year, determine if the year is even or odd, or a leap year. 

To be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four â€“ except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.

Odd year: Return a string "odd".

Even year: Return "even" unless it is leap year.

Leap year: Return a string "leap".

Test Cases:

2025 = odd

2024 = leap

2023 = odd

2022 = even

2020 = leap

2000 = leap

1900 = even (end of century year but not divisible by 400)

Note: the input will only be positive integers

Hint 1: The use of modulo operator "%" may be useful in this problem. It returns the remainder of a division. 5%3 = 2 (because 5/3 equals 1 with remainder 2)

Hint 2: Recall that multiple conditions can be checked in one statement (Note - it is possible to do assignment without this) For example, 
```
if (condition 1) and (condition 2) and (condition 3):
    # do some action 
```

### Problem 2

Modify the problem2 function by adding additional lines of code so that it solves the following problem:

When given a number, `given_number`, return a list of all values that are trianglular numbers that are less than or equal to the given_number

triangle number: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number

Remember you are returning a list of numbers!

Test Cases:

Input = 8 -> Output = [1,3,6]

Input = 10 -> Output = [1,3,6,10]

Input = 16 -> Output = [1,3,6,10,15]

Input = 21 -> Output = [1,3,6,10,15,21]

Note: the input will only be positive integers.

Hint 1: The use of casting may be useful depending on your strategy to solve the problem (though not required). If you are getting a variable type error, casting to certain type of variable may help. https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp


## What to Submit and How

#### First make sure you have passed the test cases in the homework before submitting! If you pass the test cases you have a good probability (but not guaranteed) to do well on the final test cases. 

The only file you need to modify for this homework is `problems.py`

Once you have a version of your code (that you have `commit`ted using `git commit` and `push`ed using `git push`) that you are happy with, you are done! Do not make changes to code that has been provided to you except where specified.

**NOTE: You should verify that your code files are showing up correctly on GitHub once you have `push`ed them from your local machine.**

You might want to try using the ssh key if you face issues while submitting homework1, see the final section of the README for information on this.

## Resubmitting:
If you want to update your submission before the deadline then re-commit and re-push your files. Ensure that you do both `git commit` and `git push` on your updated files so that they appear on GitHub. 


## SSH key (IF NEEDED)

Directions for adding ssh key on GitHub:
Here is a link to instructions if you need more help: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

You may want to use ssh keys to clone your repository if cloning using https gives you problems. To do this, you need to first generate an ssh key pair on your local machine. On your local machine, open a terminal and type:

1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
   make sure "your_email@example.com" is the same email used on GitHub

2. Press "Enter" when prompted where to store keys. This will result is saving the keys to a default location.

3. Enter a secure pass phrase that you will remember. 

4. That's it! Keys will be saved in .ssh/

Now, you must enter your public key on GitHub. To do this, type 'cd .ssh/' on your local machine and then copy your PUBLIC key. Then, login to your GitHub repo, click on your profile picture in the upper right hand corner, click on Settings, click on SSH and GPG Keys, click New SSH Key, create a title so you will know which computer the ssh key corresponds to, paste the PUBLIC key, and finally click Add SSH Key.
